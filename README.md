# How does it work?
## [Text2Picto](http://picto.ccl.kuleuven.be/index.php)
This mod wouldn't be possible without the use of this existing translation technology.
It would be good to get this running on the host machine, instead of using their server as it does currently if the Demo server goes down eventually.
Its images come from [Sclera Symbols](https://sclera.be/en/vzw/home).
