Adds [PECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_exchange_communication_system) [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication) to minecraft multiplayer. Provides both in-game message translation to PECS images as well as a web interface for PECS input via a tablet or mobile phone, available at https://edeetee.github.io/pictocraft/.

You can [download the Pictocraft installer from here](https://github.com/edeetee/pictocraft-installer/blob/master/README.md) or if you already have [fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) installed, you can download the latest release [from this repo](https://github.com/edeetee/pictocraft/releases).

## Features
- Translates received messages into PCS using [Text2Picto](http://picto.ccl.kuleuven.be/index.php)
- Web interface for input on a touchscreen device
- Displays mentioned minecraft blocks and items
- Random color identifiers for players

# How does it work?
## [Text2Picto](http://picto.ccl.kuleuven.be/index.php)
This mod wouldn't be possible without the use of this existing translation technology.
It would be good to get this running on the host machine, instead of using their server as it does currently if the Demo server goes down eventually.
Its images come from [Sclera Symbols](https://sclera.be/en/vzw/home).

## Input Development

- Grid systems are easier to read
- Colored pictos are more enjoyable
- Most kids are used to navigating through categories by clicking on a general icon

## Future
- User testing
- Do translation locally
