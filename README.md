## [Text2Picto](http://picto.ccl.kuleuven.be/index.php)
This mod wouldn't be possible without the use of this existing translation technology.
It would be good to get this running on the host machine, instead of using their server as it does currently if the Demo server goes down eventually.
It's images are [Sclera Symbols](https://sclera.be/en/vzw/home).

## Development

[video example](https://photos.app.goo.gl/rG3nujY5LnPR7PsF8)

Uses the existing Text2Pict online translation demo to translate text inside minecraft for children with language disabilities.

You'll have to create your own Pusher api key in order to use the login functionality.
On my machine I have a file PusherApi.java that contains the private api keys.

I think the above could be my key!!

### Input Development

- Grid systems are easier to read
- Colored pictos are more enjoyable
- Most kids are used to navigating through categories by clicking on a general icon

## Thoughts

### Future
- Input system
- User testing
- Do translation locally
